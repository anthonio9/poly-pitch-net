== Experiments

`poly_pitch_net_experiments` directory contains scripts with the implementation of training, inference and valuation of 
the Poly Pitch Net models with the use of the GuitarSet dataset. When running the `experiment.py` script for the first time, 
make sure that the `../generated/` directory is empty - this is the _cache_ directory for all the validation and training sets.
If any errors related to missing dictionary keys occur, make sure that the `reset_data` flag in the GuitarSet init calls is set to *True*.
